Stative verbs can be used in simple tenses
Stative verbs can't be used in continuous tenses
State verbs are verbs which do not normally have continuous tenses because they describe a state rather than an action.
 - verbs which express likes and dislikes: ==like, love, hate, dislike, enjoy, prefer, etc.==
- verbs of perception: ==believe, know, notice, remember, forget, recognise, understand, realise, seem, think, etc.==
- verbs of the senses: ==see, hear, feel, taste, look, smell, sound==. We often use can or could with these verbs when we refer to what we see, hear, etc. at the moment of speaking.
- some other verbs: ==be, contain, fit, include, matter, need, belong, cost, owe, mean, own, apper, want, have (= possess), etc==.
Some state verbs have continuous tenses, but there is a difference in meaning.
