**Subject (S) + have/has + past participle (V3/ed)**

### Examples:

1. **I have visited** many countries.
2. **She has worked** in several companies.
3. **They have completed** their projects on time.
4. **He has learned** to speak three languages.
5. **We have seen** that movie before.
6. **You have achieved** a lot in your career.
7. **The team has won** several awards.

### Explanation:

- **Subject (S):** This can be any noun or pronoun (I, you, he, she, it, we, they).
- **have/has:** Use "have" for I, you, we, they and "has" for he, she, it.
- **past participle (V3/ed):** This is the third form of the verb, often ending in -ed for regular verbs (e.g., worked, visited), but it can be irregular (e.g., seen, done).

This structure helps convey that the action or experience is relevant to the present moment, connecting past experiences with the present.
